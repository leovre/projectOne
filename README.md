PROJECT 1: Infinite Runner

UX/UI:
When the website is launched, the game will start automatically. 

The user will use space to jump over obstacles that will come towards the player. 

if user gets hit by one of the obstacles, the game will end and the score will be displayed to the player while having the option to restart the game. 

The user cannot use any other keys other than the space bar to jump.

when the game restarts, scores will be reset and (future feature) the speed will go back to default. 

FEATURES TO ADD: 
use the down arrow to slide and avoid other type of obstacles. 
use side keys to move around the arena.
use weapon to slay mobs.
