PROJECT 1: Endless runner

UX/UI:
user will click the play button, it will disappear, and a score number will replace the play button.

user will use up arrow to jump over obstacles that will come towards the player. 

the longer the game goes(the higher the score number), the faster the obstacles that will come to the player.

if user gets hit by one of the obstacles, the game will end and the score will be displayed to the player. 


FEATURES TO ADD: 
use the down arrow to slide and avoid other type of obstacles. 
use side keys to move around the arena.
use weapon to slay down other creatures.
